## Project Description

The App is a tool for organising your photos. After authorising, you can upload a album of your favorite photos and then add profiles of people in those images. The app will then organise your photos according to those profiles you created.
There is still alot that can be done with this app but at its current state it accomplishes what I was trying to do.
